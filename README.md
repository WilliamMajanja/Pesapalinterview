1. Growing up, I was fascinated by the idea of machines that could think and act. Robotics was the gateway drug. Disassembling old toys and tinkering with microcontrollers ignited a spark, leading me down the rabbit hole of programming. Soon, the thrill of understanding how systems worked morphed into a curiosity about their vulnerabilities. A harmless fascination with bypassing security measures and exploring the digital frontier, fueled by the same spirit of curiosity that once drove me to take apart toys, led me into the world of computing. 

2.Frederick McKinley Jones, a name often overlooked in history books, ignited my passion for innovation. His groundbreaking inventions, particularly in refrigeration technology, revolutionized transportation and food preservation. As a young, curious mind, I was captivated by the story of a Black inventor who defied societal expectations and made significant contributions to the world. His journey from humble beginnings to becoming a renowned inventor inspired me to pursue a career in technology, fueled by the desire to create solutions that would positively impact society, just as Jones had done.
